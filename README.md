# Project Title

recipe4u is a fullstack application, using react, nodeJS and mognoDB. You can log in to the application, with a strong profile authentication via email. It is also possible to reset the password via email. On the profile you can create new and original recipes, then edit them, or remove them. If you like other recipes, you can save them to your favourites. Anyway, the project bets binds on code maintainability and future expansion.
